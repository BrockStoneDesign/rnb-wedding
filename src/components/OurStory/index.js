        	<h2>Our Story</h2>
          	<p>Rhylee and Brock met back in 2016, after a brief courtship through an online dating website called 'Plenty Of Fish'.  Rhylee had come across Brocks profile, and immediately put him into her 'interested folder", as she took notice that their profiles were very similar. They both liked the outdoors, exploring new areas, and hiking. They both also had dogs, and were very family oriented.</p>

            <p>Rhylee decided to make the first move by sending Brock a message. They chatted for a few days, and then decided to meet in person. 
              For the first date, they decided to meet in Washington, D.C at a brewery called Bluejacket. They bonded over a similar fondness and appreciation for craft beers, and great food! ....</p>

              <p>As the night went on, they realized they had many other similar interests, and conversation flowed easily. It was by far one of the best first dates for both of them. "We hit it off immediately. No nervousness. It was like we had been friends, and we'd been hanging out together forever!" 
              They ended the evening with a walk by the waterfront, and Brock walked Rhylee back to her car. No kiss goodbye, only a promise of getting together again in the near future.</p>
              <p>The following weekend came, and Rhylee and Brock had made plans to see one another again. Good times continued between them, and memories were being made. The courtship was pretty short and sweet, and after about a month of dating, they decided to make things official. Brock brought Rhylee back home to PA for a visit, and introduced her to many of his close friends, and family members. He says after that weekend, that was when he knew she was the 'real deal', and he recalls that weekend telling his mother "she might be the one." </p>

               <p>Fast forward about a year and a half. Many holidays and birthdays had come and gone for them both. The relationship between Rhylee and Brock had been established, and it was pretty clear they were falling deeper in love with one another every day.</p>

               <p>After living an hour away from one another, they had decided to move in together, and would now share the parenting role of their dog Cooper.</p>

               <p>After the big move, Rhylee and Brock were closer than ever, and they had realized how easy and happy love was for them both! </p>

               <p>On April 14, 2018, Brock had planned a beautiful day in D.C for he and Rhylee, to enjoy the cherry blossoms that were now in season, and one of Rhylee's favorite things about the city. Rhylee did not know at the time, but Brock had planned a proposal for underneath a cherry blossom tree, right along the water of the Tidal Basin. It was the perfect moment, one they would remember forever! And of course, she said YES!</p>

               <p>Exactly 30 days later, on May 14, 2018, Rhylee and Brock and were married in a civil ceremony, outside of a courthouse that is within walking distance from their house.</p>

               <p>This year, on their one year anniversary on May 14, 2019, they have decided to celebrate their sacrament of marriage with their closest family members, in a ceremony at St. Vincent Basilica. This is something that is very important to them both, and are very much looking forward to sharing this special moment.</p>
