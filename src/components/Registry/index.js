                    <p>Our life together has already begun,<br/>
                    we have almost everything under the sun. <br/>
                    If you should wish to give us a gift, <br/>
                    a little extra money would sure give us a lift. <br/>
                    It would go towards a house or our honeymoon,<br/>
                    and we would always be grateful knowing it is thanks to you!<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
